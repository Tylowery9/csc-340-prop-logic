# csc-340-prop-logic
A "follow-me" plus an assignment for our study of Propositional Logic in AI

## Installs

`pip install truth-table-generator`

## Part 1
Follow along with me in class as we re-learn some propositinal logic while learning how to use the `truth-table-generator` library to represent our logic problems.

We will also attempt to map a small part of Wampus World to propositinal logic

## Part 2
On your own map the following problem to propositional logic using the `truth-table-generator` library.

* If it is rainy outside I am inside
* If I am inside I am NOT outside and vice versa.
* If I am outside I am either in my car are on a walk
* If I am in my car, I am NOT on a walk and vice versa.
* IF I go on a walk I wear a sweater

Print out the truth table.

Now add two perceptrons:

* It is NOT raining outside
* I am on a walk

Print out the truth table again.
